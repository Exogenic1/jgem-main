# Doctor Work Schedule System - Simple Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a simple doctor work schedule system where doctors can set their arrival and departure times (e.g., 7:30 AM arrival to 10:30 AM departure). The system integrates with the appointment booking system to prevent appointments outside these hours.

## Key Components

### 1. Models
- **DoctorSchedule** (`lib/models/doctor_work_schedule.dart`)
  - Simple model with arrival time and departure time
  - Methods to check if currently working and validate appointment times
  - Format display methods for UI

### 2. Services
- **DoctorWorkScheduleService** (`lib/services/doctor_work_schedule_service.dart`)
  - CRUD operations for doctor schedules
  - Database operations using `doctor_work_schedules` table
  - Helper methods for checking doctor availability

### 3. UI Components
- **DoctorScheduleScreen** (`lib/screens/appointments/doctor_work_schedule_screen.dart`)
  - Simple interface for doctors to set their work hours
  - Time pickers for arrival and departure times
  - Save functionality to database

- **TodayDoctorWidget** (`lib/widgets/dashboard/today_doctor_widget.dart`)
  - Updated to use simple doctor work schedules
  - Shows working doctors for today
  - Displays work hours and current status

### 4. Integration
- **Appointment System** (`lib/screens/appointments/add_appointment_screen.dart`)
  - Validates appointment times against doctor work hours
  - Prevents booking outside doctor's scheduled hours
  - Shows appropriate error messages

## Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE doctor_work_schedules (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  doctor_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  doctor_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  arrival_time TEXT NOT NULL,    -- HH:MM format
  departure_time TEXT NOT NULL,  -- HH:MM format
  is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);
```

## Key Features

### For Doctors
1. Set arrival time (when they come to clinic)
2. Set departure time (when they leave clinic)
3. Simple time picker interface
4. Notes field for additional information

### For Patients/Staff
1. Cannot book appointments outside doctor's work hours
2. Clear error messages when trying to book outside hours
3. Dashboard shows which doctors are currently working
4. Work schedule display in "Today's Doctors" widget

### Appointment Validation
- Checks if selected appointment time is within doctor's work hours
- Shows doctor's work schedule in error message for clarity
- Only applies to appointments with doctors (not laboratory-only appointments)

## Removed Components

### Deleted Files
- Complex doctor availability system
- Time slot management system
- Weekly schedule management
- Day-of-week scheduling

### Updated Files
- `add_appointment_screen.dart` - Updated to use simple work schedules
- `today_doctor_widget.dart` - Simplified to show current working doctors
- `main.dart` - Route updated to use simple doctor schedule screen

## Usage

### Setting Doctor Schedule
1. Navigate to "Doctor Schedule" from main menu
2. Select doctor from dropdown
3. Set arrival time (e.g., 7:30 AM)
4. Set departure time (e.g., 10:30 AM)
5. Save schedule

### Booking Appointments
1. System automatically validates appointment time
2. If time is outside doctor's work hours, shows error
3. Error message includes doctor's actual work hours
4. Patient can then select appropriate time

### Dashboard
1. "Today's Doctors" widget shows currently working doctors
2. Green indicator for doctors currently in clinic
3. Work hours displayed for each doctor
4. Real-time status updates

This simple system provides all necessary functionality for managing doctor work schedules while being easy to understand and maintain.

## Code Cleanup Completed

The following legacy components have been completely removed from the codebase:

### Removed Files
- `lib/services/doctor_schedule_service.dart` - Legacy service with complex scheduling
- Complex time slot and weekly availability systems

### Consolidated System
- All doctor scheduling now uses the simple `DoctorWorkScheduleService`
- Single source of truth for doctor work hours
- Consistent behavior across all components (dashboard, appointments, scheduling)
- No conflicting or duplicate scheduling services

The system is now fully consolidated around the simple arrival/departure time model, with all legacy code removed to prevent confusion and maintenance issues.
